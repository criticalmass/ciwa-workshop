# Introduction

Welcome to the CIWA Summer 2019 Workshop! Today, we'll be learning all about web fundamentals: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### The Goal

Today's goal is to get acquainted with HTML, CSS and JavaScript-based web programming to create a simple chat application. You can think of it like your own personal Facebook Messenger! We'll be using modern tools and learn a lot over the course of the day. 

The objective is not to understand every single line of code, but to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, server-client relationships, and be inspired by how much can be created with so little code!

This is a sample of what we'll be making: [https://px43i.sse.codesandbox.io/](https://px43i.sse.codesandbox.io/)
